    <h3>Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib</h3>
    <p>If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. Here are some tips from Chef John to get you started:</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
